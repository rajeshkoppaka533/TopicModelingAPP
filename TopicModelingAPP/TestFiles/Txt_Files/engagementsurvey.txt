Each of us has a voice, and a role, in building the company we aspire to be. Two weeks ago, we launched Engagement@Conduent, our first-ever companywide engagement survey, to gather insights into how you feel about working at Conduent. Our goal is simple: to gather your honest and candid feedback around a few key questions — the answers to which could create meaningful, positive impacts on our ability to make Conduent an employer of choice.   
Your feedback is so vital to our engagement and improvement efforts that we are extending the survey deadline to Wednesday, Sept. 19, to ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate. The survey takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete, and all responses are confidential and anonymous to Conduent. You can access the survey directly here, as well as through the ConduentConnect homepage (Quick Links > Engagement@Conduent survey).

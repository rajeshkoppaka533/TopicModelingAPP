We’re excited to announce our next companywide YamJam session with four of our global leaders. The YamJam is an opportunity for everyone across Conduent to join in a conversation on our internal social network, Yammer, for a real-time, online discussion about building a unified, “One Conduent” culture. Use this link to join the Yammer group and jam with us: https://www.yammer.com/conduent.onmicrosoft.com/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=15609063&view=all. 

Purpose of the YamJam
Each of us plays an important role in helping shape Conduent’s culture. Building on our core values YamJam in May, we are taking the conversation a step further for insights and suggestions about how we can create a unified culture that’s defined by an engaged, motivated workforce. 
We want to hear your thoughts on the following questions: 
•         How can we inspire our 80,000-strong workforce, across nearly 30 countries and a diverse set of businesses, to feel connected to a “One Conduent” culture? 
•         What are some of the ways your managers drive collaboration and team building?
•         How can we create a workplace where everyone feels motivated to deliver their best as we continue along our transformation journey?
•         What are some successful strategies and best practices to create an even stronger sense of community across all our locations?
